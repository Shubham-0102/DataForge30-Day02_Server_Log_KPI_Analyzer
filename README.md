# DataForge30 – Day 2: Server Log KPI Analyzer

## Overview
This project is part of the **DataForge30 challenge**, where I build one real-world project every day.

On Day 2, I analyzed a real Apache-style server log to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) used in production systems.

---

## Objectives
- Parse server access logs
- Extract meaningful KPIs
- Generate an automated report

---

## KPIs Extracted
- Total number of requests
- Number of unique IP addresses
- GET vs POST request count
- Error request count (4xx/5xx)

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Regular Expressions
- Google Colab

---

## Files
- `access.log` – Sample server log
- `Day2_Server_Log_KPI_Analyzer.ipynb` – Analysis notebook
- `day2_log_kpi_report.txt` – Generated KPI report

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Log parsing using regex
- KPI thinking from a data engineering perspective
- Building reproducible data analysis workflows
